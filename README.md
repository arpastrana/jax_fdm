JAX FDM enables the solution of inverse form-finding problems for discrete force networks using the force density method (FDM) and gradient-based optimization. 
It streamlines the integration of form-finding simulations into a deep learning architecture for machine learning research. 

### Key features

- **Legendary form-finding solver.**
JAX FDM computes a state of static equilibrium for a discrete force networks with the [force density method (FDM)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045782574900450), the time-tested form-finding solver backed up by over 50 years of peer-reviewed research.
<!--  -->
- **Autotune those force densities.**
Form-found structures must fulfill design constraints to become viable structures in the real world.
Formulate inverse form-finding scenarios like this as an optimization problem with JAX FDM.
Then, let one of the framework's gradient-based optimizers automatically tweak the force densities of a network to obtain a state of static equilibrium that meets the defined design constraints.
<!-- Some popular examples of inverse form-finding problems include best-fitting a vault to an arbitrary target shape, minimizing the load path of a funicular network, or controlling the thrust and the supports of a bridge. -->
<!-- (Coming soon: tweak the support positions and the applied loads, in addition to the force densities, too!). -->
- **Rich bank of goals, constraints and loss functions.**
No two structures are alike.
JAX FDM allows you to model your custom inverse form-finding problem with JAX FDM's (growing!) collection of goals, constraints and loss functions via a simple, object-oriented API.
The available goals and constraints in the framework are granular and can be applied to the entire network, or to a subsets of its nodes, edges and combinations thereof! 
<!-- Don't see a goal or a constraint you fit?. Add yours with ease! Consult our documentation guide (in progress) to see how you add yours. -->
- **Derivatives, JIT compilation and paralellization.**
JAX FDM is written in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), a library for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research, and it thus inherits many of JAX' perks: calculate derivatives, parallelize, and just-in-time (JIT) compile entire form-finding simulations written in Python code.
The same JAX code can be run in a CPU, or in multiple GPUs or TPUs (ü§Ø). Accelerate your simulations with minimal burden!
<!--  -->
- **Form-finding as another layer in a neural network.**
Since it is automatically differentiable, JAX FDM can be seamlessly added as a module of a differentiable function approximator (a.k.a. a neural network) that can be then trained end-to-end.
Let the neural network learn the underlying physics of static equilibrium *directly* from form-finding solver instead of resorting to laborious techniques like data augmentation!

JAX FDM is a research project under development.
Expect sharp edges and possibly some API breaking changes as we continue to support a broader set of features.

## Installation

```bash
pip install jax-fdm
```

Requires Python 3.7+, JAX 0.3.17+, Numpy 1.23.3+, Scipy 1.9.1+, and COMPAS 1.16.0+.
For visualization, use COMPAS_VIEW2 +0.7.0.

## Documentation

Work in progress! Expect a release soon.

## Quick example

Say the goal is to compute the form of an arch that minimizes the total Maxwell load path of an arch subjected to vertical point loads, while constraining the length of its segments between 0.75 and 1.
We solve this inverse form-finding problem with the SLSQP optimization algorithm.

```python
from jax_fdm.datastructures import FDNetwork
from jax_fdm.equilibrium import constrained_fdm
from jax_fdm.optimization import SLSQP
from jax_fdm.constraints import EdgeLengthConstraint
from jax_fdm.goals import NetworkLoadPathGoal
from jax_fdm.losses import PredictionError
from jax_fdm.losses import Loss


network = FDNetwork.from_json("data/json/arch.json")
network.edges_forcedensities(q=-1.0)
network.nodes_supports(keys=[node for node in network if network.is_leaf(node)])
network.nodes_loads([0.0, 0.0, -0.2])

loss = Loss(PredictionError(goals=[NetworkLoadPathGoal()]))
constraints = [EdgeLengthConstraint(edge, 0.75, 1.0) for edge in network.edges()]
optimizer = SLSQP()

c_network = constrained_fdm(network, optimizer, loss, constraints=constraints)
c_network.to_json("data/json/arch_constrained.json")
```

We visualize the unconstrained form-found `network` (gray) and the constrained one, `c_network` (in teal), with COMPAS VIEW2, and draw lines between their nodes:
