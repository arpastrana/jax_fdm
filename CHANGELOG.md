## [0.6.0] 2023-04-30

### Added

Support for differentiable CPU sparse solver
- Added support for differentiable CPU and GPU sparse solvers to compute the XYZ coordinates of the free nodes with FDM. The solver is custom made and registered via a `jax.custom_vjp`. The forward and backward passes of the sparse solver were made possible thanks to the contributions of @denizokt. This solver lives in `equilibrium.sparse.py`.
- Added `spsolve_gpu` and `spsolve_cpu`. The sparse solver backend is different (the former uses CUDA and the latter scipy) and it gets selected automatically based on what the value of `jax.default_device` is at runtime with function `register_sparse_solver`.
- Implemented `EquilibriumStructureSparse`.
- Division of responsabilities: created a `EquilibriumModelSparse` that solves for static equilibrium using an `EquilibriumStructureSparse` and the sparse solver. `EquilibriumModel` implements the dense linear solver.

### Changed

- `LossPlotter` instantiates a dense `EquilibriumModel`.

### Removed
