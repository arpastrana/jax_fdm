## [0.8.1] 2023-12-05

### Added

#### Losses
- Implemented `LogMaxError`. The goal of this error function is to work as a barrier soft constraint for target maximum values. One good use example would be to restrict the height of a shell to a maximum height.

### Removed


## [0.8.0] 2023-11-23

### Added

#### Models
- Added support for efficient reverse-mode AD of the calculation of equilibrium states in the presence of shape-dependent loads, via implicit differentiation. Forward-mode AD is pending.
- Added `EquilibriumModel.equilibrium_iterative` to compute equilibrium states that have shape-dependent edge and face loads using fixed point iteration.
- Added `EquiibriumModel.edges_load` and `EquiibriumModel.faces_load` to allow computation of edge and face loads.
- Implemented `EquilibriumModelSparse.stiffness_matrix`.
- Implemented `EquilibriumModel.stiffness_matrix`.
- Implemented `EquilibriumModel.force_matrix`.
- Implemented `EquilibriumModel.force_fixed_matrix`.
- Added `linearsolve_fn`, `itersolve_fn`, `implicit_diff`, and `verbose` as attributes of `EquilibriumModel`.
- Added `Equilibrium.load_nodes_iter` as attribute to include the node loads in `LoadState.nodes` when running `EquilibriumModel.equilibrium_iterative()`. Defaults to `False`.

#### Equilibrium
- Restored `vectors` field in `EquilibriumState`.
- Implemented `equilibrium.states.LoadState`.
- Implemented `equilibrium.states.EquilibriumParametersState`.

#### Solvers
- Implemented `solver_anderson`, to find fixed points of a function with `jaxopt.AndersonAcceleration`. The implicit differentiation operator of the solver provided by `jaxopt` is deactivated when using `EquilibriumModelSparse` because `jaxopt` does not support sparse matrices yet.
- Defined a `jax.custom_vjp` for `fixed_point`, an interface function that solves for fixed points of a function for different root-finding solver types: `solver_fixedpoint`, `solver_forward`, and `solver_newton`. 
- Implemented `solver_fixedpoint`, a function that wraps `jaxopt.FixedPointIterator` to calculate static equilibrium iteratively.
- Implemented `solver_forward`, to find fixed points of a function using an `equinox.while_loop`.
- Implemented `solver_netwon`, to find fixed points of a function using Newton's method.

#### Loads
- Added `equilibrium.loads` module to enable support for edge and face-loads, which correspond to line and area loads, respectively.
These two load types can be optionally become follower loads setting the `is_local` input flag to `True`. A follower load will update its direction iteratively, according to the local coordinate system of an edge or a face at an iteration. The two main functions that enable this feature are `loads.nodes_load_from_faces` and `loads.nodes_load_from_edges`. These functions are wrapped by `EquilibriumModel` under `EquiibriumModel.edges_load` and `EquiibriumModel.faces_load`. 
- Implemented `equilibrium.loads.nodes_`.

#### Datastructures
- Report standard deviation in `FDDatastructure.print_stats()`.
- Added constructor method `FDNetwork.from_mesh`.
- Added `FDMesh.face_lcs` to calculate the local coordinaty system of a mesh face.
- Added `datastructures.FDDatastructure.edges_loads`.
- Added `datastructures.FDMesh`.
- Added `datastructures.Datastructure`.
- Implemented `structures.EquilibriumStructureMeshSparse`.
- Implemented `structures.EquilibriumStructureMesh`.
- Implemented `structures.Mesh`.
- Implemented `structures.MeshSparse`.
- Implemented `structures.Graph`.
- Implemented `structures.GraphSparse`.
- Added `FDNetwork.is_edge_fully_supported`. 
- Added `EquilibriumMeshStructure.from_mesh` with support for inhomogenous faces (i.e. faces with different number of vertices). The solution is to pad the rows of the `faces` 2D array with `-1` to match `max_num_vertices`. 

#### Goals

- Implemented `NetworkXYZLaplacianGoal`.
- Implemented base class `MeshGoal`.
- Implemented `MeshXYZLaplacianGoal`.
- Implemented `MeshXYZFaceLaplacianGoal`.
- Implemented `MeshAreaGoal`.

#### Optimization

#### Geometry

- Added `line_lcs` to compute the local coordinate system of a line.
- Added `nan` gradient guardrail to `normalize_vector` calculations.

#### Parameters
- Added support for mesh vertex parameters.

#### Numerical
- Added explicit array integer types in `__init__`: `DTYPE_INT_NP` and `DTYPE_INT_JAX`

#### Sparse solver
- Set `spsolve_gpu_ravel` as the default sparse solver on GPUs (`spsolve_gpu`).
- Added `spsolve_gpu_ravel` to solve the FDM linear system all at once on GPUs.
- Implemented helper function `sparse_blockdiag_matrix` to `spsolve_gpu_ravel`.

#### Visualization
- Added `plotters/VectorArtist` to custom plot loads and reactions arrows.
- Implemented `LossPlotter._print_error_stats` to report loss breakdown of error terms.

### Changed

#### Models

#### Equilibrium
- The functions `fdm` and `constrained_fdm` take iterative equilibrium parameters as function arguments.
- The functions `fdm` and `constrained_fdm` can take an `FDMesh` as input, in addition to `FDNetwork`.

#### Sparse solver
- Decoupled `sparse_solver` from any force density calculations. Now, it is a simpler solver that only takes as inputs the LHS matrix `A` and the RHS matrix `b`, and thus, it could be used to potentially solve any sparse linear system of equations. Its signature now is analogous to that of `jax.numpy.linalg.solve`.
- Condensed signature of sparse linear solver `sparse_solve` to take a structure `EquilibriumStructure` as input, instead of explicit attributes of a structure.
- Changed signature of `sparse_solve_bwd` to take two arguments, where the first is the "residual" values produced on the forward pass by ``fwd``, and the second is the output cotangent with the same structure as the primal function output (`sparse_solve`).
- Condensed signature of helper functions `sparse_solve_fwd` to take matrices `A` and `b` as inputs, instead of explicit attributes of the FDM and of a `EquilibriumStructure`.
- Renamed previous verison of `spsolve_gpu` to `spsolve_gpu_stack`.

#### Geometry
- Added support for `jnp.nan` inputs in the calculations of `geometry.normal_polygon`. 

#### Losses
- Changed signature of `Regularizer.__call__` to take in parameters instead of equilibirum state. 

#### Datastructures 
- Overhauled `EquilibriumStructure` and `EquilibriumStructureSparse`. They are subclasses `equinox.Module`, and now they are meant to be immutable. They also have little idea of what an `FDNetwork` is.
- Modified `face_matrix` adjacency matrix creation function to skip -1 vertices. This is to add support for `MeshStructures` that have faces with different number of vertices.

#### Optimization
- Use `jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn(x))` instead of using `loss_fn(x)` and `jax.grad(loss_fn(x))` separately. This results in optimization speedup because we get both value and grad with a single VJP call. 
- `Optimizer.problem` takes an `FDNetwork` as input.
- `Optimizer.problem` takes boolean `jit_fn` as arg to disable jitting if needed.
- Changed `ParameterManager` to require an `FDNetwork` as argument at initialization.
- Changed `Parameter.value` signature. Gets value from `network` directly, not from `structure.network`
- `optimization.OptimizationRecorder` has support to store, export and import named tuple parameters.

#### Visualization
- Fixed bug in `viewers/network_artist.py` that overshifted load arrows.
- Edge coloring considers force sign for `force` color scheme in `artists/network_artist.py`.
- Fixed bug with the coloring of reaction forces in `viewers/network_artist.py`.
- Fixed bug with the coloring of reaction forces in `artists/network_artist.py`.
- `LossPlotter` has support to plot named tuple parameters.

### Added

### Changed

## [0.6.0] 2023-04-30

### Added

Support for differentiable CPU sparse solver
- Added support for differentiable CPU and GPU sparse solvers to compute the XYZ coordinates of the free nodes with FDM. The solver is custom made and registered via a `jax.custom_vjp`. The forward and backward passes of the sparse solver were made possible thanks to the contributions of @denizokt. This solver lives in `equilibrium.sparse.py`.
- Added `spsolve_gpu` and `spsolve_cpu`. The sparse solver backend is different (the former uses CUDA and the latter scipy) and it gets selected automatically based on what the value of `jax.default_device` is at runtime with function `register_sparse_solver`.
- Implemented `EquilibriumStructureSparse`.
- Division of responsabilities: created a `EquilibriumModelSparse` that solves for static equilibrium using an `EquilibriumStructureSparse` and the sparse solver. `EquilibriumModel` implements the dense linear solver.

### Changed
